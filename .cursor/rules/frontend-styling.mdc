# Pluto Frontend Styling Rules

1. **CSS Location**
   - All new styles must be added to existing CSS files, often in `editor.css` (not in JS files).

2. **Color Variables**
   - When introducing new colors, add them as CSS variables to both `light.css` and `dark.css` (for light and dark mode).
   - Do not use existing color variables with incorrect semantic meaning.

3. **Print Mode**
   - Pluto uses the same frontend for IDE and Print mode (e.g., PDF export).
   - If a new UI element should not appear in Print mode, add a rule to `hide-ui.css` to hide it.

4. **CSS Naming**
   - Prefer creating new custom element names (e.g., `<pluto-pkg-terminal>`) and use those as selectors in CSS.

5. **Inline Styles**
   - Avoid inline styles, unless it's something small that changes dynamically.
