Each `${}` placeholder (you may also use `#{}`) indicates a field

one [indent unit](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#language.indentUnit) per tab character after
the newline.

On activation, (all instances of) the first field are selected.
The user can move between fields with Tab and Shift-Tab as long as
the fields are active. Moving to the last field or moving the
cursor out of the current field deactivates the fields.

The order of fields defaults to textual order, but you can add
numbers to placeholders (`${1}` or `${1:defaultText}`) to provide
a custom order.

in front of it. This will be removed and the brace will not be
