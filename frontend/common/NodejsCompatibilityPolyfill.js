Some packages look for `process.env`, so we give it to them.

Why not just `window.process = { env: NODE_ENV }`?
I once had an extension that was broken and exported its `window.process` to all pages.
I'm not saying we should support that, but this code made it work.
The extension itself is now fixed, but this might just work when an extension
