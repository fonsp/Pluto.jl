# Using _JavaScript_ inside Pluto

You have already seen that Pluto is designed to be _interactive_. You can make fantastic explorable documents using just the basic inputs provided by PlutoUI, together with the wide range of visualization libraries that Julia offers.

_However_, if you want to take your interactive document one step further, then Pluto offers a great framework for **combining Julia with HTML, CSS and _JavaScript_**.

		It is easy to learn HTML and CSS because they are not 'programming languages' like Julia and JavaScript, they are <em>markup languages</em>: there are no loops, functions or arrays, you only <em>declare</em> how your document is structured (HTML) and what that structure looks like on a 2D color display (CSS).

#### Learning JavaScript
After learning HTML and CSS, you can already spice up your Pluto notebooks by creating custom layouts, generated dynamically from Julia data. To take things to the next level, you can learn JavaScript. We recommend using an online resource for this. 

> My personal favourite is [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/), a high-quality, open source tutorial. I use it too!
> 
> _-fons_

It is hard to say whether it is easy to _learn JavaScript using Pluto_. On one hand, we highly recommend the high-quality public learning material that already exists for JavaScript, which is generally written in the context of writing traditional web apps. On the other hand, if you have a specific Pluto-related project in mind, then this could be a great motivator to continue learning!

A third option is to learn JavaScript using [observablehq.com](https://observablehq.com), an online reactive notebook for JavaScript (it's awesome!). Pluto's JavaScript runtime is designed to be very close to the way you write code in observable, so the skills you learn there will be transferable!

If you chose to learn JavaScript using Pluto, let me know how it went, and how we can improve! [fons@plutojl.org](mailto:fons@plutojl.org)

# Essentials

## Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

To use web languages inside Pluto, we recommend the small package [`HypertextLiteral.jl`](https://github.com/MechanicalRabbit/HypertextLiteral.jl), which provides an `@htl` macro.

You wrap `@htl` around a string expression to mark it as an *HTML literal*, as we did in the example cell from earlier. When a cell outputs an HTML-showable object, it is rendered directly in your browser.

## Interpolation

Julia has a nice feature: _string interpolation_:

With some (frustrating) exceptions, you can also interpolate into Markdown literals:
"""

"""

# ╔═╡ a45fdec4-2d4b-429b-b809-4c256b57fffe

**However**, you cannot interpolate into an `html"` string:

As an exercise to get familiar with these techniques, you can try the following:
- 👉 Add a "reset to zero" button to the widget above.
- 👉 Make the bound value an array that increases size when you click, instead of a single number.
- 👉 Create a "two sliders" widget: combine two sliders (`<input type=range>`) into a single widget, where the bound value is the two-element array with both values.
- 👉 Create a "click to send" widget: combine a text input and a button, and only send the contents of the text field when the button is clicked, not on every keystroke.

## Selecting elements

When writing the javascript code for a widget, it is common to **select elements inside the widgets** to manipulate them. In the number-of-clicks example above, we selected the `<span>` and `<button>` elements in our code, to trigger the input event, and attach event listeners, respectively.

There are a numbers of ways to do this, and the recommended strategy is to **create a wrapper `<span>`, and use `currentScript.parentElement` to select it**.

### `currentScript`

When Pluto runs the code inside `<script>` tags, it assigns a reference to that script element to a variable called `currentScript`. You can then use properties like `previousElementSibling` or `parentElement` to "navigate to other elements".

Let's look at the "wrapper span strategy" again.

```htmlmixed
@htl("\""

<!-- the wrapper span -->
<span>

	<button id="first">Hello</button>
	<button id="second">Julians!</button>
	
	<script>
		var wrapper_span = currentScript.parentElement
		// we can now use querySelector to select anything we want
		var first_button = wrapper_span.querySelector("button#first")

		console.log(first_button)
	</script>
</span>
"\"")
```
"""

# ╔═╡ f18b98f7-1e0f-4273-896f-8a667d15605b
md"""
#### Why not just select on `document.body`?

In the example above, it would have been easier to just select the button directly, using:
```javascript
// ⛔ do no use:
var first_button = document.body.querySelector("button#first")
```

However, this becomes a problem when **combining using the widget multiple times in the same notebook**, since all selectors will point to the first instance. 

Similarly, try not to search relative to the `<pluto-cell>` or `<pluto-output>` element, because users might want to combine multiple instances of the widget in a single cell.

## Script loading

To use external javascript dependencies, you can load them from a CDN, such as:
- [jsdelivr.com](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
- [skypack.dev](https://www.skypack.dev/)

Just like when writing a browser app, there are two ways to import JS dependencies: a `<script>` tag, and the more modern ES6 import.

### Loading method 1: ES6 imports

We recommend that you use an [**ES6 import**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) if the library supports it.


##### Awkward note about syntax

Normally, you can import libraries inside JS using the import syntax:
```javascript
import confetti from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti'
import { html, render, useEffect } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htm@3.0.4/preact/standalone.mjs"
```

In Pluto, this is [currently not yet supported](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/992), and you need to use a different syntax as workaround:
```javascript
const { default: confetti } = await import("https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti@1")
const { html, render, useEffect } = await import( "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/htm@3.0.4/preact/standalone.mjs")
```
"""

# ╔═╡ 077c95cf-2a1b-459f-830e-c29c11a2c5cc
md"""

### Loading method 2: script tag

`<script src="...">` tags with a `src` attribute set, like this tag to import the d3.js library:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.2.0/dist/d3.min.js"></script>
```

will work as expected. The execution of other script tags within the same cell is delayed until a `src` script finished loading, and Pluto will make sure that every source file is only loaded once.

## Script output & `observablehq/stdlib`

Pluto's original inspiration was [observablehq.com](https://observablehq.com/), and online reactive notebook for JavaScript. _(It's REALLY good, try it out!)_ We design Pluto's JavaScript runtime to be close to the way you write code in observable.

Read more about the observable runtime in their (interactive) [documentation](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript). The following is also true for JavaScript-inside-scripts in Pluto:
- ⭐️ If you return an HTML node, it will be displayed.
- ⭐️ The [`observablehq/stdlib`](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/stdlib) library is pre-imported, you can use `DOM`, `html`, `Promises`, etc.
- ⭐️ When a cell re-runs reactively, `this` will be set to the previous output (with caveat, see the later section)
- The variable `invalidation` is a Promise that will get resolved when the cell output is changed or removed. You can use this to remove event listeners, for example.
- You can use top-level `await`, and a returned HTML node will be displayed when ready.
- Code is run in "strict mode", use `let x = 1` instead of `x = 1`.

The following is different in Pluto:
- JavaScript code is not reactive, there are no global variables.
- Cells can contain multiple script tags, and they will run consecutively (also when using `await`)
- We do not (yet) support async generators, i.e. `yield`.
- We do not support the observable keywords `viewof` and `mutable`.

## Stateful output with `this`

Just like in observablehq, if a cell _re-runs reactively_, then the javascript variable `this` will take the value of the last thing that was returned by the script. If the cell runs for the first time, then `this == undefined`. In particular, if you return an HTML node, and the cell runs a second time, then you can access the HTML node using `this`. Two reasons for using this feature are:
- Stateful output: you can persist some state in-between re-renders. 
- Performance: you can 'recycle' the previous DOM and update it partially (using d3, for example). _When doing so, Pluto guarantees that the DOM node will always be visible, without flicker._

##### 'Re-runs reactively'?
With this, we mean that the Julia cell re-runs not because of user input (Ctrl+S, Shift+Enter or clicking the play button), but because it was triggered by a variable reference.

##### ☝️ Caveat
This feature is **only enabled** for `<script>` tags with the `id` attribute set, e.g. `<script id="first">`. Think of setting the `id` attribute as saying: "I am a Pluto script". There are two reasons for this:
- One Pluto cell can output multiple scripts, Pluto needs to know which output to assign to which script.
- Some existing scripts assume that `this` is set to `window` in toplevel code (like in the browser). By hiding the `this`-feature behind this caveat, we still support libraries that output such scripts.

			Learning HTML and CSS
		</h4>
		<p>
			It is easy to learn HTML and CSS because they are not 'programming languages' like Julia and JavaScript, they are <em>markup languages</em>: there are no loops, functions or arrays, you only <em>declare</em> how your document is structured (HTML) and what that structure looks like on a 2D color display (CSS).
		</p>
		<p>
			As an example, this is what this cell looks like, written in HTML and CSS:

## Embeddable output

Pluto has a multimedia object viewer, which is used to display the result of a cell's output. Depending on the _type_ of the resulting object, the richest possible viewer is used. This includes:
- an interactive structure viewer for arrays, tables, dictionaries and more: $(embed_display([1,2,(a=3, b=4)]))
- an `<img>` tag with optimized data transfer for images: $(embed_display(demo_img))
- raw HTML for HTML-showable objects: $(embed_display(demo_html))

Normally, you get this object viewer for the _output_ of a cell. However, as demonstrated in the list above, you can also **embed Pluto's object viewer in your own HTML**. To do so, Pluto provides a function:
```julia
embed_display(x)
```

#### Example

As an example, here is how you display two arrays side-by-side:

```julia
@htl("\""

<div style="display: flex;">
$(embed_display(rand(4)))
$(embed_display(rand(4)))
</div>

"\"")

```

You can [learn more](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/pull/1126) about how this feature works, or how to use it inside packages.
