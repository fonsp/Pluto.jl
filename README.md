_Writing a notebook is not just about writing the final document — Pluto empowers the experiments and discoveries that are essential to getting there._

**Explore models and share results** in a notebook that is

- **_reactive_** - when changing a function or variable, Pluto automatically updates all affected cells.
- **_lightweight_** - Pluto is written in pure Julia and is easy to install.
- **_simple_** - no hidden workspace state; friendly UI.

### Input

A Pluto notebook is made up of small blocks of Julia code (_cells_) and together they form a [**_reactive_** notebook](https://medium.com/@mbostock/a-better-way-to-code-2b1d2876a3a0).
When you change a variable, Pluto automatically re-runs the cells that refer to it. Cells can even be placed in arbitrary order - intelligent syntax analysis figures out the dependencies between them and takes care of execution.

Cells can contain _arbitrary_ Julia code, and you can use external libraries. There are no code rewrites or wrappers, Pluto just looks at your code once before evaluation.

### Output

Your notebooks are **saved as pure Julia files** ([sample](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/blob/main/sample/Basic.jl)), which you can then import as if you had been programming in a regular editor all along. You can also export your notebook with cell outputs as attractive HTML and PDF documents. By reordering cells and hiding code, you have full control over how you tell your story.

## Dynamic environment

Pluto offers an environment where changed code takes effect instantly and where deleted code leaves no trace.
Unlike Jupyter or Matlab, there is **no mutable workspace**, but rather, an important guarantee:

<blockquote align="center"><em><b>At any instant</b>, the program state is <b>completely described</b> by the code you see.</em></blockquote>
No hidden state, no hidden bugs.

### Interactivity

Your programming environment becomes interactive by splitting your code into multiple cells! Changing one cell **instantly shows effects** on all other cells, giving you a fast and fun way to experiment with your model.

In the example below, changing the parameter `A` and running the first cell will directly re-evaluate the second cell and display the new plot.

<br >

### Built-in package manager

Pluto uses syntax analysis to understand which packages are being used in a notebook, and it **automatically manages a package environment** for your notebook. You no longer need to install packages, you can directly import any registered package like `Plots` or `DataFrames` and use it.

To ensure reproducibility, the information to exactly reproduce the package environment is **stored in your notebook file**. When someone else opens your notebook with Pluto, the exact same package environment will be used, and packages will work on their computer, automatically! _[more info](https://plutojl.org/pkg/)_

<br >

### Interactivity with `@bind`

Lastly, here's _**one more feature**_: Pluto notebooks have a `@bind` macro to create a **live bond between an browser widget and a Julia variable**. Combined with reactivity, this is a very powerful tool!

<img alt="bind macro example where moving a slider changes the value of a variable, and a value that is computed from the variable" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06286537-fff3-4cef-aafb-036a4a0ea1f5" width="50%">

## Pluto for teaching

Pluto was developed alongside the free online course [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) at MIT, with the goal of creating a programming environment that is powerful, helpful and interactive, without being too intimidating for students and teachers. 

Are you interested in using Pluto for your class? Here are some presentations by people who are using it already: [the MIT team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFRI3s0DE-o), [Gerhard Dorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qs5EXDpZBI), [Daniel Molina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrIxgnFXslg), [Henki W. Ashadi](https://youtu.be/GnEKgW23PvY?t=586) and [Max Köhler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H5KgSIWsWQ).

## From the authors

The Pluto project is an ambition to [_rethink what a programming environment should be_](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming). We believe that scientific computing can be a lot simpler and more accessible. If you feel the same, give Pluto a try! We would love to hear what you think. 😊
